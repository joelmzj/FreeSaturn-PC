# FreeSaturn - Pc
## Freezer Reborn
### Your go-to **ToS Compliant** Custom Deezer Client

 For non-premium Deezer users.
(I've just removed premium account verification. Obviously premium features, as flac and 320kb qualities, doesn't work unless you use a Premium account. So, you can use this mod with both premium and free accounts. :)  )

### Donations
https://fund.saturn.kim/

# Featuring:
- [Listening Parties (Clubs)](https://clubs.saturn.kim)
- FLAC & MP3 320 support
- BYO Last.fm Integration (Safer solution!)
- Discord Listen Together & RPC
- Fixed homepage
- Minor updates to make things work with newer API
- Redundant importer removed
- (aaand don't forget everything the older app had)
